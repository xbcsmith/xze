# Tutorials

This directory contains learning-oriented tutorials for the XZe project following the Diátaxis framework.

## What are Tutorials?

Tutorials are lessons that guide you through learning XZe step-by-step. They are:

- Learning-oriented
- Hands-on and practical
- Safe to follow (show the happy path)
- Provide a sense of achievement

## Future Content

As XZe is implemented, this directory will contain:

- **Getting Started**: First-time setup and basic usage
- **Your First Documentation Generation**: Analyze a repository and generate docs
- **Working with Events**: Set up webhooks and Kafka integration
- **Deploying XZe**: Deploy with Docker and Kubernetes
- **Using the SDK**: Build custom integrations with xze-sdk

- Ollama running locally or accessible remotely
- Git installed

## Contributing

When adding tutorials:
