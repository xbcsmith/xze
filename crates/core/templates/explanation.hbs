{{#each mechanisms}}
#### {{name}}

{{description}}

{{#if example}}
**Example:**

```{{../language}}
{{example}}
```
{{/if}}

{{/each}}
{{else}}
The implementation of {{concept}} involves several interconnected mechanisms:

1. **Initialization**: Setting up the necessary components
2. **Coordination**: Managing interactions between parts
3. **Execution**: Carrying out the core operations
4. **Cleanup**: Managing resources and state
{{/if}}

### Data Flow

{{#if data_flow}}
{{data_flow}}
{{else}}
Understanding how data moves through the system is crucial:

1. **Input**: Data enters the system through defined entry points
2. **Processing**: Components transform and analyze the data
3. **Storage**: Results are stored or cached as needed
4. **Output**: Results are delivered to the appropriate destinations
{{/if}}

### Interaction Patterns

```
{{/if}}

{{/each}}
{{else}}
Components interact through well-defined patterns:

- **Request/Response**: Synchronous operations with immediate feedback
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous notifications between components
- **Pipeline**: Sequential processing through stages
- **Pub/Sub**: Broadcasting events to interested subscribers
