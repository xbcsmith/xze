# Tutorial: {{topic}}

## What You Will Learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use {{topic}} in this project. By the end, you will have a solid understanding of the concepts and practical experience implementing them.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of {{language}}
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Development environment set up

**Time to Complete:** Approximately 30-45 minutes

## Introduction

{{#if project_description}}
{{project_description}}
{{/if}}

This tutorial will guide you through {{topic}} step by step, with hands-on examples you can follow along.

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics

Let's start by understanding the core concepts.

{{#if relevant_types}}
### Key Types

{{#each relevant_types}}
#### {{kind}} `{{name}}`

{{#if documentation}}
{{documentation}}
{{/if}}

{{#if fields}}
**Fields:**
{{#each fields}}
- `{{name}}`: `{{type_annotation}}`
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

{{/each}}
{{/if}}

---

## Step 2: Setting Up

Before we begin, let's set up our environment.

{{#if setup_code}}
```{{language}}
{{setup_code}}
```
{{/if}}

**What's happening here?**
- We're importing the necessary modules
- Setting up the basic configuration
- Preparing our workspace

---

## Step 3: First Example

Now let's create our first working example.

{{#if example_functions}}
### Using the Functions

{{#each example_functions}}
#### Example: {{name}}

```{{../language}}
{{signature}}
```

{{#if documentation}}
{{documentation}}
{{/if}}

**Try it yourself:**

```{{../language}}
// Example usage
{{#if example_usage}}
{{example_usage}}
{{else}}
// TODO: Add example usage for {{name}}
{{/if}}
```

{{/each}}
{{/if}}

---

## Step 4: Building Something Real

Now that you understand the basics, let's build a complete example.

### Complete Example

```{{language}}
{{#if complete_example}}
{{complete_example}}
{{else}}
// Combine the concepts from previous steps
// 1. Set up your configuration
// 2. Initialize the required types
// 3. Use the functions we learned about
// 4. Handle results appropriately
{{/if}}
```

### Breaking It Down

Let's understand what each part does:

1. **Initialization**: We start by setting up our environment
2. **Configuration**: We configure the necessary parameters
3. **Execution**: We run our main logic
4. **Cleanup**: We handle any cleanup operations

## Step 5: Common Patterns

Here are some common patterns you'll use frequently:

{{#if patterns}}
{{#each patterns}}
### Pattern: {{name}}

{{description}}

```{{../language}}
{{code}}
```

{{/each}}
{{else}}
### Pattern 1: Basic Usage

Follow the examples from the previous steps as templates for your own implementations.

### Pattern 2: Error Handling

Always handle errors appropriately to make your code robust.

### Pattern 3: Testing

Write tests for your implementations to ensure they work correctly.
